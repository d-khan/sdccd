# Accommodating Students with Disabilities

Students with disabilities who may need academic accommodations should contact me as soon as possible.  You and I will work with the Disability Support Programs and Services (DSPS) department to identify your appropriate academic accommodations for this course. 

> DSPS is located in the K1 Student Services building, room K1-204 and can be reached at (619) 388-7312 or by email at miradsps@sdccd.edu. To register or to learn more about their services, please visit their website at www.sdmiramar.edu/dsps
