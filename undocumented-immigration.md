# Undocumented & Immigrant Student Services

Undocumented and immigrant students are welcome in this class. As an educator, I strive to be an ally and provide a safe learning environment for you regardless of your immigration status. Your legal status should not be an obstacle to you in my classroom or to your educational success.
The Miramar Dreamers Support Office provides programs and services to undocumented and immigrant students. The Dreamers staff can meet with you for one-on-one support sessions, connect you to financial aid and scholarship resources, provide information about how to earn money, and host weekly engagement activities. Every student who needs one gets a FREE immigration-related legal consultation with our partners at the Higher Education Legal Services, too!
