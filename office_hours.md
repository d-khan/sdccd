## Office Hours Preparation Checklist

Before joining office hours, make sure you:

☐ Know what question or topic you want help with

☐ Tried the problem at least once on your own

☐ Reviewed lecture notes or examples related to the topic

☐ Have your assignment, lab, or quiz open

☐ Have your code ready to show (if applicable)

☐ Noted any error messages or confusing steps

☐ Can explain what you expected vs. what happened

☐ Have something to take notes with

💡 Tip: Office hours are not for getting answers handed to you — they’re for learning how to think through problems. Come prepared, and you’ll get much more out of them.
