# Use of Artificial Intelligence Tools 
Artificial intelligence tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.) are becoming part of the professional computing environment, and students are expected to understand both their benefits and limitations. In this course:

**a. Permitted Use**

- You may use AI tools to assist your learning (e.g., clarifying concepts, debugging hints, generating pseudocode).
- If you use AI-generated code or explanations, you must explicitly document this in your submission (include the prompt and the AIâ€™s response in an appendix or comments).

**b. Prohibited Use**

- Submitting AI-generated code as your own work without understanding it is considered academic dishonesty.
- Using AI to complete entire assignments or projects without your own contribution is not acceptable.

**c. Expectations**

- You are responsible for being able to explain, trace, and modify any code you submit.
- During grading, you may be asked to orally explain your solution or perform a live coding task. Inability to explain your code will result in loss of credit.

**d. Learning Goal**

- The purpose of assignments is for you to develop your own coding ability and problem-solving skills. AI tools may help, but they cannot replace the practice you need to succeed in future courses and careers.
