# Sustainability

Miramar College is committed to sustainability in our classrooms and on campus. To minimize paper use, please consider whether a document can be shared digitally rather than printed. When a document must be printed, decrease margins to 0.8‚Äù and print on both sides of the paper.  
 
You are encouraged to bring reusable drink containers to school (and fill them at the water dispensers located around campus). For single-use packaging, please use the recycle bins for plastics, paper, cans, and cardboard.  
 
Thank you for doing your part to conserve resources in your academic life and keeping our campus environment clean.
