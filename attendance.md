# Attendance/Absences

**Please note that in-person class attendance is mandatory to avoid dropping or withdrawing from the course**.
-  It is the student’s responsibility to drop all classes in which they are no longer participating/attending.
-  It is the instructor’s discretion to withdraw a student after the add/drop deadline due to excessive absences.
- __(For asynchronous classes):__ Students who do not submit assignments or engage in peer discussions during the first two weeks will be dropped for non-attendance. 
- __(For synchronous classes):__ The instructor will drop the student if a student is absent in the first two weeks.
- Students who remain enrolled in a class beyond the published withdrawal deadline, as stated in the class schedule, will receive an evaluative letter grade in this class. (A, B, C, D, F, P, NP)
