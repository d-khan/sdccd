# Rising Scholars

If you have been incarcerated or affected by the criminal-legal system, we have resources for you! The Miramar Rising Scholars program offers support services for currently and formerly incarcerated students. On campus, the Rising Scholars office supports formerly incarcerated and system-impacted students through resources such as admissions and financial aid application assistance, priority registration, counseling, stipends and vouchers, community events (including clean slate clinics/expungement services), a student club, and more. Miramar Rising Scholars also offers an Entrepreneurship degree program for students incarcerated at the Naval Consolidated Brig, Miramar, a military prison onboard Marine Corps Air Station Miramar. 

> The Rising Scholars office is located on the third floor of the Student Services building in K1-304. Rising Scholars staff can be reached at miramarrisingscholars@sdccd.edu or 619-388-7222. Learn more at https://sdmiramar.edu/services/risingscholars.
